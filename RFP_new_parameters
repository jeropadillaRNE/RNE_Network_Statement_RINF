# PROPOSED PARAMETERS FROM RFP TO BE ADDED TO ERA ONTOLOGY
## Problem setting

As part of RNEâ€™s work supporting the IMs digitalising their network statement, RNE has been
contracted to study, define and propose additional infrastructure parameters which would be
needed for RINF to effectively cover the nature of the infrastructure part of the Rail-FacilitiesPortal. After comparison between the parameters of the RFP with those of the RINF Register of
Infrastructure and ERA Vocabulary, RNE proposed the following parameters to enrich ERA Ontology and as inputs for future developments of the RINF application.
